# StudentManagementSystemWithGPAClaculator

Hello World, this repo is about a student management system which provides the following features :

1)Create a student's record
2)Search for a student's record
3)Display all records
4)Delete a record
5)Modify a record

Important Note : 
The program utilizes a file called "Students.txt" to store the students data even if you exit the program.
To have a thorough understanding of the file structure, please note that the file is abstractly divided into blocks, with 9 lines for each block.

Each block represents the record of one student :
The line number 1 stores the student's roll number.
The line number 2 stores name.
The lines from 3 to 8 store the student's grades.
The line number 9 (last line of the block) stores the student's grade.
